# Figure_Reproduction_Project
Reproduction of Publication Figures using published data. 

Depending on the computational tools and methods used, RNA-seq analysis done by different researchers 
may yield notably different results. For this reason, it is important for researchers to be explicit about the 
computational methods they employ and the ways in which they normalize their data.  


Liang et al. made their processed RNA-Seq data available alongside their publication. The authors 
primarily used R tools for their analysis and visualizations. In an effort to assess the reproducibility of 
their data analysis and evaluate how the choice of tools and methods (Python vs. R) impacts the results 
and visualizationsâ€“ in this report, the available data was used to recreate three of their figures.
